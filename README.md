# 👋 Yo, I’m Aston

*Engineer by trade. Photographer by obsession.*
Always chasing the next great line of code and the next ray of light.*

### 🚦 What Drives Me

- **Software that feels like magic, not just machinery.**
- **Design that’s elegant but never overdesigned.**
- **Photography that slows the world down and finds soul in the streets.**
- **Code as craft, not just work.**
- **People over process. Always.**

### 📷 My Split Life

Some days I’m deep in code:  
☕️ → 💻 → 🧩 → 🚀

Other days I’m wandering around with my camera in hand.
